# NodeJs-TwitterSearch

I wanted to learn and understand if I could use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to try to do a twitter message body search. The node package I ended up using was [Twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit).

In order to do this project I did the following to get started. 

```
mkdir nodejs-twittersearch
cd nodejs-twittersearch/
npm init
(created the appropriate package.json)
npm install twit --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm install express --save
```

Once I was done I created the index.css and index.html file that I wanted to be able to submit a form. By following the documentation of Node, Express and Twit I was able to retrieve 25 tweets, that I wanted, and displayed it with some html.
